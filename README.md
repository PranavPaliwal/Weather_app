## 📋 Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the weather application.
- `style.css`: Defines the styling for the application.
- `script.js`: Implements the functionality, including API calls and dynamic background changes.

## 🔑 API Key

This project uses an OpenWeatherMap API key. For security reasons, it's recommended to keep API keys private. In a production environment, consider using environment variables or a secure backend to handle API requests.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Visit the [live demo](https://whatsweathernoww.netlify.app/) to use the application directly in your browser.
2. Alternatively, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-application.git
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the application locally.
4. Enter a city name in the search bar to fetch weather information.

## ⚠️ Note

The current implementation includes the API key directly in the JavaScript file. For improved security, consider implementing a backend service to handle API requests or use environment variables to store sensitive information.
